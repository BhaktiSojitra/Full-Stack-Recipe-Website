            "Option 1) Blend everything while the coffee is hot and then chill it overnight in a jar with a lid. It will separate, so just give it a good shake in the morning and pour over ice and youâ€™ll be good to go. " ,
            "Option 2) Soak your cashews in water for a few hours and give them a good rinse. Now they should blend up nicely with cold coffee â€“ either cold press or just chilled brewed coffee.",
            "I used very coarse flaked sea salt in this coffee, so just a word to the wise that it might not be best to put 1/2 teaspoon of regular table salt in the coffee! That will be way too salty. If using table salt, just start with a tiny pinch and taste and adjust from there."]

Place the chicken in a plastic bag and use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the dressing (without peanut butter) to marinate the chicken in the fridge for about 15-30 minutes.

              "Potentially unpopular opinion? But I like to leave the WHOLE lime in the juice because the rind and pith of the lime gives a bitterness to the finished agua fresca that I think is so, so delicious. (Reminds me of this pie.) Also, since I donâ€™t add alcohol to mine, this helps it feel slightly more like a cocktail. ðŸ™‚ If youâ€™re not a fan of any bitter flavor, just use lime juice instead of whole limes." ]
