        <h2>Hi, my name is Lindsay!</h2>
        <div>And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!</div>
        <div>I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started 
            as a casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a 
            fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) 
            that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with 
            content that has been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, 
            Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, 
            and more.
            I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. 
            My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, 
            and going to the dog park.
